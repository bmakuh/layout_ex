VILLAGES

Villages is a social bookkeeping application, designed to streamline the process of finding temporary caregivers for one's children.  While many parents could hire a babysitter, they instead opt for neigborhood networks that accomplish much the same.  The drawbacks of the system is that it is hard to maintain a "balance" of who did what and how much it was worth.

Villages changes all of that.

Villages is a credit-based system that takes all the legwork of booking dates and managing a balance and frees parents up to take the time they need.

Villages is a web-based app written in Ruby on Rails.

Version 1.0 was completed in the summer of 2011 by Colorado School of Mines CS field session group R41nB0W K4TZ.
